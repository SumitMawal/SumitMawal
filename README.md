# Hi, I'm Sumit Mawal! 👋

I'm a passionate network and security engineer based in Pune, Maharashtra, India. With a strong background in configuring **Checkpoint, Palo Alto firewalls** and **F5** I've honed my skills in User-ID, Content-ID, App-ID, security profiles, NAT, policy management, and more. Additionally, I've delved into **AWS** and **Python** automation scripts, documenting my experiences on GitHub.

## What I'm Up To:

- 🌐 **Network and Security:** I thrive on solving complex network challenges. Whether it's designing secure architectures or troubleshooting connectivity issues, I'm in my element.
- ☁️ **AWS Enthusiast:** I'm exploring the vast AWS ecosystem, from EC2 instances to Lambda functions. My ongoing projects involve deploying applications, managing resources, and optimizing costs.
- 🐍 **Python Aficionado:** Python is my go-to language for automation. I've written scripts for everything from automating backups to orchestrating cloud resources.
- 📚 **GitHub Storyteller:** You'll find my journey documented on GitHub. From code snippets to detailed project write-ups, I believe in sharing knowledge and learning together.

## Fun Facts:

- 🎧 When I'm not doing coding or configuring firewalls, I'm probably listening to tech podcasts.
- 🎥 I also have YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SumitM_informedminds" target="_blank">Informed Minds</a>.
